title: Summarizing my B.Sc. in Mathematics at Bielefeld University
---
This post gives a detailed overview over what I learned and how I did in my Bachelor degree. 
I have majored in Mathematics with minor subjects Computer Science and Physics
at [Bielefeld University](https://uni-bielefeld.de).

## General: Studying in Bielefeld

Most of my courses at Bielefeld University were structured like this:
- lecture (usually twice a week)
- a weekly homework sheet
- weekly tutorial (where we discussed the exercises) 
- a final exam (usually written)

You are only allowed to do the exam if you have reached enough points in
the homework (corrected by a student tutor) and if you have presented your
homework solutions at least twice in the tutorials.

The grade scale ranges from 1.0 to 4.0 (1.0 is the best, 4.0 is the worst 
grade still counting as "passed"). When you fail an exam, you are assigned 
the grade 5.0.

### Winter semester 2017/2018

This was my first university semester right after school. I started out with
Mathematics as major and Physics as minor.

### Summer semester 2018

In my second semester I decided to take a second minor: Computer Science.
I did this, because I did not like physics as much as I thought and by choosing a 
second minor I could split the required 60 credit points into 30 each.
Also, I have been coding a lot in my free time in school, anyway, so I hoped that 
computer science would refine my practical skills with a little theory.

	- OOP: (modelling, MVC, inheritance, generics)

### Winter semester 2018/2019

This was a very packed semester. I scored about 55 credit
points (of 180 total) and started to work for [Dr. Thorsten Hüls][huels] as a teaching 
assistant (for his lecture "Mathematical Methods") and as a programmer (see my [vita](/vita.html)
for more infos).

	- introduction to the Chomsky hierarchy
	- complexity
	- basic data structures like lists, trees, ... and algorithms on them
	- many insight into further topics like hashing

### Summer semester 2019

I continued my programming work for [Dr. Hüls][huels] and worked as a teaching assistant
for an Analysis 1 course held by [Prof. Oleksandr Kutovyi][kutovyi].
Even though I did not score as many credit points as in the last semester, this one was
by far the most exhausting. 

- **Algebra 2** ([Dr. Mima Stanojkovski][stanojkovski])
	- module theory
	- tensor products of modules

	- spectral theory
- **Pro-seminar on Fourier analysis** (lecturer [Prof. Sebastian Herr][herr]) - 
	We had to work out a topic for ourselves and then give a talk on it. 
	By far the worst talk I have ever given. My topic was:
	- Poisson kernel, Dirichlet problem and heat conduction
- **Introduction to Physics 4** ([Prof. Dario Anselmetti][anselmetti]) - This lecture was accompanied by a career orientation seminar.
	- quantum physics
	- more statistical mechanics
	- nuclear physics
- **Software Group-Project** ([Dr. Sebastian Wrede][wrede], [Dr. Sven Wachsmuth][wachsmuth])
	- developing a project (a seminar room booking app for the company "Capgemini") with 
a random team of ~10 students


### Winter semester 2019/2020

In my fifth and last semester at Bielefeld University, I did teaching assistance in
Linear Algebra 1 ([Prof. Michael Spieß][spiess]) and Linear Algeba for Physicists by 
[Prof. Baake][baake].

I wrote my Bachelor thesis supervised by [Prof. Baake][baake] and [Prof. Voll][voll]
in analytic combinatorics. More details on my thesis **[here (NOT YET PUBLISHED)]()**

- **regular seminar of the [working group Baake][baake]**
	- tilings
	- dynamical systems
	- and a lot of other topics that I really didn't understand :)
- **Bachelorseminar Algebra** ([Prof. Christopher Voll][voll])
	- quadratic forms
	- basic concepts of algebraic number theory
	- Hilbert class field
	- my talk: subgroup $\zeta$ functions of $\mathcal{T}$-groups
- **Numerical Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equations** ([Prof. Lars Diening][diening])
	- basics of ODEs
	- Runge-Kutta methods
	- basics of weak derivatives and Sobolev spaces
	- Discontinuos-Galerkin method

## Grades

Even though I was disappointed by my thesis it somehow scored a 1.7, which is quite good.
That makes a 1.8 in my major (see [here](#general-studying-in-bielefeld) for the grade system).
However, I got a 2.7 in both of my minors. (Funny how my grade decay in physics reflected my 
loss of interest: 1.0 > 2.7 > 3.7 ^^).
My final grade for the Bachelor degree sums up to **2.1**.

For comparison under the math 
graduates of the last 3 years at Bielefeld university this grade belongs to the top ~39%. 
An okey grade, I think.
