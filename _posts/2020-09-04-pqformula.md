title: The pq-formula
category: math

The pq-formula is used to solve quadratic equations.

Consider the general equation
\\[ a x^2 + b x + c = 0 \\]
for \\(a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}\\).

Assuming \\(a \neq 0\\) and dividing by \\(a\\) yields
\\[ x^2 + p x + q = 0 \\]
with \\(p = \frac ba\\) and \\(q = \frac ca\\).

Then, the solutions are given by
\\[
	x_{1,2} = -\frac p2 \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac p2 \right)^2 - q}.
\\]
